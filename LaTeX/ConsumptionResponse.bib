  abstract =      {Macroeconomic models often invoke consumption
                   “habits” to explain the substantial persistence
                   of aggregate consumption growth. But a large
                   literature has found no evidence of habits in
                   microeconomic datasets that measure the behavior of
                   individual households. We show that the apparent
                   conflict can be explained by a model in which
                   consumers have accurate knowledge of their personal
                   circumstances but ‘sticky expectations’ about the
                   macroeconomy. In our model, the persistence of
                   aggregate consumption growth reflects consumers’
                   imperfect attention to aggregate shocks. Our proposed
                   degree of (macro) inattention has negligible utility
                   costs, because aggregate shocks constitute only a
                   tiny proportion of the uncertainty that consumers
                   face.},
